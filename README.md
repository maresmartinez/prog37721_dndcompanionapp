# DnD Companion App

Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game that has amassed a strong following over the past few decades. The game allows players to create characters of a variety of fictional races and character classes, and shape that character’s personality throughout the game’s campaign. While the game can be a lot of fun, there are many systems and rules behind D&D that can make it complicated and difficult to jump into. The purpose of this application is to give D&D players the tools to easily manage a campaign and character so that users can focus on actually playing the game.
