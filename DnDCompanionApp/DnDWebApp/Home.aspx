    <p class="lead">This web application is a companion app for D&D players.</p>

    <p>Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game that has amassed a strong following over 
        the past few decades. The game allows players to create characters of a variety of fictional races and 
        character classes, and shape that character’s personality throughout the game’s campaign. While the game 
        can be a lot of fun, there are many systems and rules behind D&D that can make it complicated and difficult 
        to jump into. The purpose of this application is to give D&D players the tools to easily manage a campaign 
        and character so that users can focus on actually playing the game.</p>

    <p>One of the most difficult things to do when starting a D&D campaign is to create a character. Characters 
        have many different attributes, such as skill points, abilities, race, class, attacks, appearance, 
        background, and more. This application will organize these attributes into a manageable form that will 
        allow users to select the appropriate options and easily create a character.</p>

    <p>This application will also be useful for Dungeon Masters (DMs). DMs serve as the game’s referee and 
        storyteller; they manage their players’ journey throughout the game and give their own spin on the 
        mechanics of D&D. There is only one DM per campaign. This application will allow DMs to manage their 
        players’ characters and form groups for separate campaigns that they are leading.</p>

    <p>In summary, the purpose of this application is to allow players and DMs to manage the complexity of a D&D 
        campaign, while still giving players and DMs the control to create any worlds or characters they can 
        imagine.</p>
